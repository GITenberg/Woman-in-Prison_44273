description: While I was waiting, that advertisement returned to my reflections, and
  urged its cause imperatively as a command. It was a call, to me, resistless as the
  voice that awoke the young Israelitish Prophet from his slumbers. In another moment
  the struggle with my pride was over, and my spirit answered, -I will go, even to
  lust-besotted Sodom if thou leadest, Light of my path! I seated myself in a street
  car, went to the prison, applied for the place, and obtained it. Day by day I wrote
  down what I saw and heard, what I said and did. Why? In obedience to the same Voice
  that called me to.
